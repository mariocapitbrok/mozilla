//Suppose you have an array of tasks, and you want to move a task to the front of the list to prioritize it. You can achieve this by using the copyWithin() method:

const tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4', 'Task 5']
const taskToPrioritize = 2

tasks.splice(0, 0, tasks[taskToPrioritize])
tasks.splice(taskToPrioritize + 1, 1)

console.log(tasks)
// ['Task 3', 'Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 4', 'Task 5']

/*
In this case, we first use the splice() method to insert the task at index taskToPrioritize (2), which is 'Task 3', to the first position (index 0) in the tasks array. Then, we use the splice() method again to remove the task from its original position, effectively prioritizing it. This code correctly moves 'Task 3' to the front of the tasks array without affecting the original values or creating a new array.
