//Modifying the array during iteration

//The following example logs one, two, four.

//When the entry containing the value two is reached, the first entry of the whole array is shifted offâ€”resulting in all remaining entries moving up one position. Because element four is now at an earlier position in the array, three will be skipped.

//forEach() does not make a copy of the array before iterating.

const words = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
words.forEach(word => {
  console.log(word)
  if (word === 'two') {
    words.shift() //'one' will delete from array
  }
}) // one // two // four

console.log(words) // ['two', 'three', 'four']
