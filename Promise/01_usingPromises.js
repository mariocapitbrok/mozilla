/*
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Since most people are consumers of already-created promises, this guide will explain consumption of returned promises before explaining how to create them.

Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function. Imagine a function, createAudioFileAsync(), which asynchronously generates a sound file given a configuration record and two callback functions: one called if the audio file is successfully created, and the other called if an error occurs.

Here's some code that uses createAudioFileAsync():
*/
function successCallback(result) {
  console.log(`Audio file ready at URL: ${result}`)
}

function failureCallback(error) {
  console.error(`Error generating audio file: ${error}`)
}

createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings, successCallback, failureCallback)

// If createAudioFileAsync() were rewritten to return a promise, you would attach your callbacks to it instead:
createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings).then(successCallback, failureCallback)

// This convention has several advantages. We will explore each one.
