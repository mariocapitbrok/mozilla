//Whitout initial value.

//The code below shows what happens if we call reduce() with an array and no initial value.

const arrayA = [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

function reducer(accumulator, currentValue, index) {
  const returns = accumulator + currentValue
  console.log(
    `accumulator: ${accumulator}, currentValue: ${currentValue}, index: ${index}, returns: ${returns}`
  )
  return returns
}

arrayA.reduce(reducer)

/*

The callback would be invoked four times, with the arguments and return values in each call being as follows:

accumulator	currentValue	index	Return value
First call	    15	        16	  1	    31
Second call	    31	        17	  2	    48
Third call	    48	        18	  3	    66
Fourth call	    66        	19	  4	    85

The array parameter never changes through the process â€” it's always [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The value returned by reduce() would be that of the last callback invocation (85).
