//The at() method takes an integer value and returns the item at that index, allowing for positive and negative integers. Negative integers count back from the last item in the array.

console.log(`Using an index of ${index} item returned is ${array1.at(index)}`)
// Expected output: "Using an index of -2 item returned is 130"
